# Real-time Facial Emotion Recognition

This project implements a real-time facial emotion recognition system using Python, OpenCV, and Keras. It detects faces through a webcam feed, predicts the emotions associated with each detected face, and overlays the predicted emotion labels onto the video stream in real-time.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/real-time-facial-emotion-recognition.git

pip install -r requirements.txt





2.Ensure your webcam is connected to your computer.
to run the code juste type :

python run_me.py



Pre-trained Model
The pre-trained model for facial emotion recognition is included in the repository as my_model.h5. This model has been trained on a dataset containing facial images labeled with seven different emotions: angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, and neutral.
